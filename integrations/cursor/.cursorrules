# Talkback Voice Notifications

You have access to voice notifications via talkback. Use them to keep the user informed.

```bash
npx talkback-cli "Your message here"
```

Play a beep:
```bash
npx talkback-cli --beep success  # or: --beep error
```

## When to Use

- **Task completion**: `npx talkback-cli "Done: implemented the feature"`
- **Errors**: `npx talkback-cli "Error: tests failed" --priority critical`
- **Long operations**: Announce before and after
- **Questions**: `npx talkback-cli "I have a question about the database schema"`

## Options

- `--voice <name>`: alex, sam, jordan, casey, morgan
- `--speed <speed>`: fast, normal, slow
- `--priority <level>`: critical, high, normal, low
- `--summarize`: AI-summarize long messages
- `--stream`: Lower latency for longer messages

## Examples

```bash
# Announce completion
npx talkback-cli "Build complete, all tests passing"

# Error with high priority
npx talkback-cli "Build failed with 3 errors" --priority critical

# Summarize verbose output
npx talkback-cli "$(cat build.log)" --summarize
```
